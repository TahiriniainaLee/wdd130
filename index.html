        <p>My name is Tahiriniaina Andrianaivo, I'm from Madagascar. I'm a student online in
            BYU-Pathway Worldwide and I follow the course of web development and software development; I enjoy this
            course a lot because it shows me the real background behind our laptop or phone screens, something I’ve
            always wanted to understand. I'm looking forward to creating my own website and business. Additionally, my
            hobby is playing video games and chess.

        <p>The history of Madagascar is rich and complex, ranging from its initial settlement by people from Indonesia
            and Africa, to its colonial history marked by French and British influences, to its independence in 1960 and
            its
            post-independence development. The island is also known for its unique biodiversity and endemic wildlife,
            including lemurs .</p>
